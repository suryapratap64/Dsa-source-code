// In Competitive Programming (CP), the greedy method is an algorithmic approach used to solve optimization problems by making a series of choices. The key idea is to make the best local choice at each step with the hope that these local solutions will lead to an optimal global solution. Greedy algorithms are particularly effective when a problem has an optimal substructure, meaning an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions to its subproblems.

// Key Characteristics of the Greedy Method:
// Greedy Choice Property: At each step, the choice that seems the best at that moment is chosen, with no reconsideration of the choice in the future.
// Optimal Substructure: An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.
